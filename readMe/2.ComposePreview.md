# Preview
- In Jetpack Compose we can see the preview of our code in Android studio. It allows us to see the output without running our app.

## How to add Preview
- You need to add @Preview() annotation before the composable function. After adding this annotation we are able to see the preview of our UI.
```
@Preview()
@Composable
fun DefaultPreview() {
    Text("Hello World!")
}
```
## What customization to make in Preview  annotation
```
@Preview annotation you can see the following options:
annotation class Preview(
    val name: String = "",
    val group: String = "",
    @IntRange(from = 1) val apiLevel: Int = -1,
    // TODO(mount): Make this Dp when they are inline classes
    val widthDp: Int = -1,
    // TODO(mount): Make this Dp when they are inline classes
    val heightDp: Int = -1,
    val locale: String = "",
    @FloatRange(from = 0.01) val fontScale: Float = 1f,
    val showSystemUi: Boolean = false,
    val showBackground: Boolean = false,
    val backgroundColor: Long = 0,
    @UiMode val uiMode: Int = 0,
    @Device val device: String = Devices.DEFAULT
)
```
## How to customize?
- There are two ways you can customize the preview.
1. Set the customization by manually typing.
2. Using preview editing tool.

## Name

- @Preview(name = "Preview1")
- If you give the name argument it will show the given name ("Preview1") in your preview area.
- We can add multiple previews in same class, so if you give the name you can identify easily.

## Background

- The composable function does not define any background on its own, but you can add one to the
  preview by setting showBackground = true in the Preview annotation.
- There’s also backgroundColor argument to change the color.
```
@Preview(name = "Preview1",  showBackground = true, backgroundColor = 0xFF03A9F4)
```
## Height and Width
- Composable function set it's width and height by default in a wrap_content. 
- If you want to change pass the desired widthDp and heightDp values.
```
@Preview(name = "Preview1",  showBackground = true, widthDp = 200, backgroundColor = 0xFF03A9F4, heightDp = 50)
@Composable
fun DefaultPreview() {
    Text(text = "Hello world")
}
```
## 4. SystemUI and Device
- You can preview a composable function in a dummy screen (with a status bar, Toolbar and navigation menu). 
- Just set showSystemUi = true and you are ready. 
- You can also change the device frame used — e.g. device = Devices.PIXEL.
```
    @Preview(name = "Preview1", device = Devices.PIXEL, showSystemUi = true)
    @Composable
    fun DefaultPreview() {
        Text(text = "Hello world")
    }
```

## Multiple Previews
- You can add multiple previews. 
- Just add @Preview annotation in your composable.
- Preview 1
```
    @Preview(name = "Preview1", showBackground = true, backgroundColor = 0xFF2196F3)
    @Composable
    fun Preview1() {
        Text(text = "Hello world 1")
    }
```
- Preview 2
```
    @Preview(name = "Preview2", showBackground = true, backgroundColor = 0xFF2196F3)
    @Composable
    fun Preview2() {
        Text(text = "Hello world 2")
    }
```

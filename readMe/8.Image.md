# Image
```
@Composable
fun Image(
    painter: Painter,
    contentDescription: String?,
    modifier: Modifier = Modifier,
    alignment: Alignment = Alignment.Center,
    contentScale: ContentScale = ContentScale.Fit,
    alpha: Float = DefaultAlpha,
    colorFilter: ColorFilter? = null
)
```
- To create an image, you need following parameters
- **a). Painter** - to load a drawable from resources you need to use painterResource.
- you need to pass drawable resource id as a parameter in painterResource and It will return the painter.
- fun painterResource(@DrawableRes id: Int): Painter
- **b) ContentDescription** - You need to give description about the image. You can set it as null.
- **c) Modifier (Optional)**
- If you don't use the modifier, Image will take the original resource size as size.  So use modifier to set the fixed size and avoid design related issues.

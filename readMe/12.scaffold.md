- Scaffold allows you to implement a UI with the basic Material Design layout structure. 
- Scaffold provides slots for the most common top-level Material components, such as TopAppBar, BottomAppBar, FloatingActionButton, and Drawer
## What's Scaffold?
- It allows you to implement a UI with the basic Material Design layout structure.
- You can add the following widgets with the help of Scaffold,
1) TopAppBar (Toolbar)
2) Floating Action Button (FAB)
3) Drawer Menu 
4) Bottom Navigation 

## Structure of Scaffold:
```
Scaffold(
    topBar = { //your top bar  },
    floatingActionButton = {//your floating action button},
    drawerContent = { //drawer content },
    content = { //your page content},
    bottomBar = { //your bottom bar composable }
)
```
## What is Scapfold
- At its core, Scaffold is a composable that provides a structured layout, designed to handle the basic layout patterns that are commonly used in Android apps. 
- It allows developers to place key components such as an app bar, a bottom navigation bar, and floating action buttons with ease, while also giving full control over the main content of the screen.
- Here’s a breakdown of the main components that Scaffold provides:
- **TopBar:** For placing a toolbar or custom top app bar.
- **BottomBar:** For a bottom navigation bar or similar UI elements.
- **FloatingActionButton (FAB):** For an action button that floats above the content.
- **Drawer:** To add navigation drawers.
- **Snackbar:** For showing snackbars when user feedback is required.
- **Content:** The main area where most of the app’s UI will live.
## TopBar
- The TopBar slot is a convenient place to add a TopAppBar, which is commonly used to display the app’s title, navigation icons, and actions. Here’s how you can add a TopAppBar to a Scaffold:
```
Scaffold(
    topBar = {
        TopAppBar(
            title = { Text("My App") },
            navigationIcon = {
                IconButton(onClick = { /* Handle navigation */ }) {
                    Icon(Icons.Filled.Menu, contentDescription = "Menu")
                }
            },
            actions = {
                IconButton(onClick = { /* Handle action */ }) {
                    Icon(Icons.Filled.Favorite, contentDescription = "Favorite")
                }
            }
        )
    },
    content = { /* Content here */ }
)
```
## Bottombar
- A BottomBar can be used for navigation or displaying key actions. Below is an example of how to add a simple BottomAppBar inside the Scaffold:
```
Scaffold(
    bottomBar = {
        BottomAppBar {
            IconButton(onClick = { /* Handle home */ }) {
                Icon(Icons.Filled.Home, contentDescription = "Home")
            }
            Spacer(Modifier.weight(1f, true)) // Push the next icon to the end
            IconButton(onClick = { /* Handle profile */ }) {
                Icon(Icons.Filled.Person, contentDescription = "Profile")
            }
        }
    },
    content = { /* Content here */ }
)
```
## FAB
```
Scaffold(
    floatingActionButton = {
        FloatingActionButton(onClick = { /* Handle FAB click */ }) {
            Icon(Icons.Filled.Add, contentDescription = "Add")
        }
    },
    content = { /* Content here */ }
)
```
## DrawerContent
- If you need a navigation drawer, Scaffold makes it easy to add one using the drawerContent parameter. 
- This allows users to swipe from the side to reveal a drawer with navigation or other options.
```
Scaffold(
    drawerContent = {
        Column {
            Text("Home")
            Text("Profile")
            Text("Settings")
        }
    },
    content = { /* Content here */ }
)
```
## Snackbar
```
val scaffoldState = rememberScaffoldState()
val scope = rememberCoroutineScope()

Scaffold(
    scaffoldState = scaffoldState,
    content = { /* Content here */ },
    floatingActionButton = {
        FloatingActionButton(onClick = {
            scope.launch {
                scaffoldState.snackbarHostState.showSnackbar("This is a Snackbar")
            }
        }) {
            Icon(Icons.Filled.Info, contentDescription = "Show Snackbar")
        }
    }
)
```
## Content Slot
- The content slot is where most of the app’s layout will reside. 
- This is where you define your custom UI, such as a LazyColumn, Box, or any other Compose component.
```
Scaffold(
    topBar = { /* TopAppBar */ },
    content = { padding ->
        LazyColumn(
            contentPadding = padding
        ) {
            items(100) {
                Text("Item #$it", Modifier.padding(16.dp))
            }
        }
    }
)
```
## What Scaffold Does Not Have
- While Scaffold provides many useful features, it’s not a one-size-fits-all solution. 
- Here are a few things it doesn’t provide:
1) **Multi-layered Layouts**
- Scaffold works well for simple layouts, but if your UI requires complex nested scaffolds or multiple layers of drawers or toolbars, you’ll need to manage those layouts manually.
2) **Custom Animations**
- While Compose supports animations, Scaffold doesn’t provide built-in transitions for elements like showing and hiding the FAB or BottomBar. 
- You’ll need to manually manage these animations.
3) **Built-in State Management**
- Scaffold focuses on UI structure, and it doesn’t manage state like whether a drawer is open or closed. 
- That’s up to you to manage using ScaffoldState and rememberCoroutineScope.
4) **Advanced Drawer Behavior**
- For more advanced navigation drawer patterns (like multi-step drawers), you’ll need to implement custom logic or use other Compose features to handle the complexity.

## Combining Scaffold with Other Compose Components
- Scaffold is highly flexible, and one of its strengths is its ability to integrate seamlessly with other composables. 
- Here’s an example of how you can combine Scaffold with a LazyColumn to create a scrollable list:
```
Scaffold(
    topBar = { /* TopAppBar */ },
    content = { padding ->
        LazyColumn(
            contentPadding = padding
        ) {
            items(50) { index ->
                Text("Item $index", Modifier.padding(16.dp))
            }
        }
    }
)
```
